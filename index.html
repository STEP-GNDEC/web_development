    <h1>Gurudwara Shri Manji Sahib, Alamgir</h1>
    <img src="alamgir.jpg"> 
<h5>
  GURUDWARA SHRI MANJI SAHIB (ALAMGIR SAHIB) is situated in the Village Alamgir In Distt Ludhiana. SHRI GURU GOBIND SINGH JI, after his four sons & mother were martyred by the Mughals, was going from Machhiwara on a bed as ” Uchh Da Pir” & reached here on 14 Poh 1761 Bikrami (1704 A.D.). On reaching here, one of the horse traders of the village named Bhai Nigahia Singh, gifted a horse to GURU SAHIB. Nabi Khan & Gani Khan were sent back with the bed. GURU SAHIB asked an old lady who was picking cow dung whether he could get some water from somewhere to take bath to which the old lady replied that ” Pir Ji this is a place of ruins, there is no water here. There is a well far away but there is a big python that lives there, no one goes there. GURU SAHIB Ji hit the python with an arrow & gave it “Mukti” ( exemption from further transmigration) & the python fell into the well. When the Sikhs went to fetch water, the water had gone bad so close to where GURU SAHIB was sitting, GURU SAHIB hit one more arrow & there was a water spring that came out & all the sikhs had a bath. On seeing this miracle, the old lady fell into GURU SAHIB’s feet & said “Peer Ji you are a wonderful Peer, I have a request. I have leprosy & I have gone to various places to get the treatment done but it has not been cured, kindly cure my disease & help me to get rid of this disease. GURU SAHIB said that whoever takes a bath under this water spring with belief, GOD will cure all his sadness. Then GURU JI sat on the horse given by Bhai Nigahia Singh & went towards Raikot. The old lady had a bath in that water spring & was cured. She went back to the village & told about the whole story. The place where Bhai Nabi Khan & Bhai Gani Khan kept GURU SAHIB’s bed, today at that place exists a beautiful Gurudwara known as Manji Sahib

The fortress is located on the banks of the river Sutlej and contains a tunnel to leading to the neighboring town of Phillaur. It was built over 500 years ago during the reign of the Sikandar Lodi and was well-maintained under the reign of Ranjit Singh and the British after him, but then fell into disrepair. It was declared a state-protected monument in December 2013.[1][2][3][4][5]

      The Government Institute of Textile Chemistry and Knitting Technology was initially based in the fort campus which is now shifted to the new address at Z - Block, Rishi Nagar, Ludhiana.
